The symbol % represents percentage.\n\nKey Concepts:\n• 1% = 1/100 = 0.01\n• 50% = 50/100 = 1/2 = 0.5\n• 100% = 100/100 = 1 (whole)\n• 200% = 200/100 = 2 (double)\n\nConversions:\n\n1. Fraction to Percentage:\n   • Multiply by 100\n   • Formula: (Fraction × 100)%\n   • Example: 3/4 = (3/4 × 100)% = 75%\n\n2. Decimal to Percentage:\n   • Multiply by 100\n   • Example: 0.75 = 0.75 × 100 = 75%\n\n3. Percentage to Fraction:\n   • Divide by 100\n   • Simplify\n   • Example: 25% = 25/100 = 1/4\n\n4. Percentage to Decimal:\n   • Divide by 100\n   • Example: 45% = 45/100 = 0.45\n\nCommon Percentages:\n• 10% = 1/10 = 0.1\n• 20% = 1/5 = 0.2\n• 25% = 1/4 = 0.25\n• 50% = 1/2 = 0.5\n• 75% = 3/4 = 0.75\n• 100% = 1",
