          "content": "Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses letters (variables) to represent unknown numbers.\n\nKey Concepts:\n\n1. Variable:\n   • A letter that represents an unknown number\n   • Common variables: x, y, z, a, b, c\n   • Example: In x + 5 = 10, x is the variable\n\n2. Constant:\n   • A fixed number that doesn't change\n   • Examples: 5, -3, 0, 100, π\n\n3. Coefficient:\n   • Number multiplied with a variable\n   • In 5x, coefficient is 5\n   • In -3y, coefficient is -3\n\n4. Term:\n   • A single number or variable or their product\n   • Examples: 5, x, 3y, -2xy, 7x²\n\n5. Expression:\n   • Combination of terms using +, -, ×, ÷\n   • Examples: 3x + 5, 2y - 7, 4x² + 3x - 2\n\n6. Equation:\n   • Two expressions connected by = sign\n   • Examples: x + 5 = 10, 2y - 3 = 7\n\nTypes of Expressions:\n• Monomial: One term (5x, 3y², -7)\n• Binomial: Two terms (3x + 5, 2y - 7)\n• Trinomial: Three terms (x² + 2x + 1)\n• Polynomial: Many terms",

Unlike Terms:\n   • Terms with different variables or powers\n   • Cannot be combined\n   • Examples: 3x and 5y, 2x and 3x²\n\nAddition and Subtraction:\n• Only like terms can be combined\n• Add/subtract coefficients, keep variable same\n• Examples:\n  - 3x + 5x = 8x\n  - 7y - 2y = 5y\n  - 4x² + 3x² = 7x²\n\nMultiplication:\n• Multiply coefficients\n• Add powers of same variable\n• Examples:\n  - 3x × 4x = 12x²\n  - 2y × 5y² = 10y³\n  - -3a × 2b = -6ab\n\nDivision:\n• Divide coefficients\n• Subtract powers of same variable\n• Examples:\n  - 12x ÷ 3x = 4\n  - 15y³ ÷ 3y = 5y²\n  - 20x²y ÷ 4xy = 5x",
