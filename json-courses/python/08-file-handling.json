Open file: open()\n2. Read/Write: read(), write(), readline()\n3. Close file: close()\n4. Use with statement (recommended)\n\nBest Practices:\n• Always close files after use\n• Use 'with' statement (auto-closes)\n• Handle exceptions\n• Check if file exists\n• Use appropriate mode\n• Be careful with 'w' mode (overwrites!)",
